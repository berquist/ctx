# `ctx` authors

``ctx`` is written and maintained by Michael F. Herbst (``info@michael-herbst.com``).
Please report any bugs or provide suggestions
on [github](https://github.com/mfherbst/ctx.git) or send them directly
to the author.

The initial design of `ctx` was adapted from the `libctx` library
of E. Epifanovsky *et. al.*, distributed as part of the
[Q-Chem](http://www.q-chem.com/) quantum chemistry package.
The `src/libctx` compatibility interface still resembles the
original interface of `libctx`, but provides a different implementation
under the hood.
