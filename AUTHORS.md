Authors of the original ``libctx``
----------------------------------
``ctx`` is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the corresponding
``libctx`` library inside the [Q-Chem](http://www.q-chem.com/) quantum
chemistry package. The interface of this very library (but not the
actual implementation) is therefore based upon Q-Chem's ``libctx``
by Epifanovsky *et. al.*.
